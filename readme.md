# Neovim dotfiles

My colleagues keep asking for my dotfiles. Therefore, I thought I would make it public one day :D (although this repo may not be up-to-date since I don't manage nvim configs with this repo)

Branches:
- Master: init.lua with a lot of new plugins made for nvim 0.5+ only
  - In this branch, one can find all the lua config for my nvim and the plugins that I use. Notably, I organise plugin settings in a modular manner to help maintain them better over time.
- Snapshot: Good old nvim with vim-compatible configurations
  - In this branch, one can find good ways to split `init.vim` into multiple files and load `lua` configs into nvim with minimum hassle.

I hope you are inspired or have learned something new during the exploration of this repo :).
