# Neovim dotfiles

My colleagues keeps asking for my dotfiles. Gotta make it public (however, it may not be up-to-date) :)

Branches:
- Master: init.lua with a lot of new plugins made for nvim 0.5+ only
  - In this branch, one can find all the lua config for my nvim and the plugins that I use. Notably, I organise plugin settings in a modular manner to help maintain them better over time.
- Snapshot: Good old nvim with vim-compatible configurations
  - In this branch, one can find good ways to split `init.vim` into multiple files and load `lua` configs into nvim with minimum hassle.
